G is a general  purpose  programmable  text editor for DOS  and UNIX.

G  is FreeWare (but an email would be appreciated!).  G may be freely
distributed.

Please email questions, problems, bugs, etc. to:

Instructions for compiling G on various platforms are included in the
initial comment at the start of src/g.c. The startup code crt0.asm is
only  for use with the Watcom  C/C++ 10 for MS-DOS (and is optional).

To get help, press F1 (then press "return" to get each page),  to get
out  of  G,   press  ESC  or F7.  You can move around and make simple
alterations to the text in the usual way,  that is,   use  the  arrow
keys, page up/down, tabs etc.  to move around, and the delete key and
back arrow (at the top right) to remove characters.  Text  is  simply
typed  in.  All the WordStar commands require the "Control" key to be
pressed   but    they    are    not   needed    for   simple   edits.

To get into the text from the "home" area, just press the down arrow.
Don't worry about the  home area for now,  this is where the powerful
context editor commands are given. To exit & save the file, press F8.

The  file  "doc/g.txt" contains  the  complete  G  reference  manual.

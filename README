G is a general purpose programmable text editor for DOS and UNIX.

G  is FreeWare (but an email would be appreciated!).  G may be freely
distributed.

Please email questions, problems, bugs etc to :-

Instructions for compiling G on various platforms are included in the
initial  comment  at  the start of g.c.  The startup code crt0.asm is
only for use with the Watcom C/C++ 10 for MSDOS (and is optional).  

To use:

Having just unzipped G, you can try it right away by typing:-

	g g.txt

To get help, press F1 (then press "return" to get each page),  to get
out  of  G,   press  ESC  or F7.  You can move around and make simple
alterations to the text in the usual way,  that is,   use  the  arrow
keys, page up/down, tabs etc.  to move around, and the delete key and
back arrow (at the top right) to remove characters.  Text  is  simply
typed  in.  All the WordStar commands require the "control" key to be
pressed but they are not needed for simple edits.

To get into the text from the "home"  area  just  press  down  arrow.
Don't  worry about the home area for now,  this is where the powerful
context editor commands are given.  To exit and save the file back to
disk, press F8.

The file g.txt contains the complete reference manual.
